3. Build and run on iOS device or simulator
4. Grant photo library permissions when prompted

### Project Structure

```

â”œâ”€â”€ Captionator.xcodeproj/          # Xcode project
â”œâ”€â”€ Captionator/                    # Main app target
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ CaptionatorApp.swift        # App entry point
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ContentView.swift           # Main view with grid layout
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ CaptionatorViewModel.swift  # View model with business logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Models.swift                # Data models (CaptionedImage, CaptionType)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ CaptionedImageCard.swift    # Individual image card component

## How It Works

1. **Image Selection**: Tap "Add Image" to select photos from your library
2. **Caption Type**: Choose between "Creative" or "Factual" caption styles
3. **AI Processing**: Apple's Vision framework analyzes the image locally on your device
4. **Caption Display**: Generated captions appear on beautiful image cards
5. **Management**: Tap and hold to delete images, or tap to view full-screen

## Technology Stack

- **SwiftUI**: Modern declarative UI framework
- **Vision Framework**: Apple's on-device computer vision API
- **PhotosUI**: Native photo picker integration
- **ObservableObject**: MVVM pattern with reactive state management
- **Swift Concurrency**: async/await patterns for image processing

## Privacy

All image processing happens locally on your device using Apple's Vision framework. No images or data are sent to external servers.
